The Second Workshop on on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}} was held on Sunday, 16 November 2014 in conjunction with the 2014 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC14)\footnote{\url{http://sc14.supercomputing.org}}.
WSSSPE2 followed a general initial workshop, WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1}, that was held in 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 conference, and a focused workshop, WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}}, that was held in 2014 in conjunction with the SciPy conference.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of software at all levels and it is critical to address challenges related to the development, deployment, maintenance and overall sustainability of reusable software as well as education around software practices. These challenges can be technological, policy based, organizational, and educational, and are of interest to developers (the software community), users (science disciplines), software engineering researchers, and researchers studying the conduct of science (science of team science, science of organizations, science of science and innovation policy, and social science communities). The WSSSPE1 workshop engaged the broad scientific community to identify challenges and best practices in areas of interest for sustainable scientific software. WSSSPE2 invites the community to propose and discuss specific mechanisms to move towards an imagined future practice for software development and usage in science and engineering. The workshop will include multiple mechanisms for participation, encourage team building around solutions, and identify risky solutions with potentially transformative outcomes. Participation by early career students and postdoctoral researchers is strongly encouraged.



\section{Submissions, Peer-Review, and Peer-Grouping}

\end{quote}

Based on the goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from those involved in software practice, ranging from initial thoughts and partial studies to mature deployments, but focusing on papers that are intended to lead to changes, the organizers wanted to make submission as easy as possible.  The call for papers stated:

\begin{quote}
We invite short (4-page) \textbf{actionable} papers that will lead to improvements for sustainable software science. These papers could be a call to action, or could provide position or experience reports on sustainable software activities. The papers will be used by the organizing committee to design sessions that will be highly interactive and targeted towards facilitating action. Submitted papers should be archived by a third-party service that provides DOIs. We encourage submitters to license their papers under a Creative Commons license that encourages sharing and remixing, as we will combine ideas (with attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop.\end{quote}

31 submissions were received, and all but one used either arXiv\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org}} or figshare\footnote{\url{http://figshare.com}} to self-publish their papers.  

The review process was fairly standard, where reviewers bid for papers, then an automated system
matched bids to determine assignments, and reviewers then completed their assigned
reviews (with an average of 4.9 reviews per paper, and 4.1 reviews per reviewer)
This process was done through EasyChair\footnote{http://easychair.org/}, which allowed reviewers to provide scores on relevance and comments to the organizers, which were used to decide which papers to associate with the workshop, and comments to the authors, which were provided back to the authors to allow them to improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 28 of the papers as significantly contributing to the workshop, a very high acceptance rate, but one that is reasonable, given the goal of broad participation and the fact that the reports were already self-published.

WSSSPE1 was organized into sessions, each of which was aimed at discussing one or more of the themes from the call for papers, with a few paper authors invited to summarize the other papers in that them as a panel, followed by general discussion about that theme.  The mapping of papers to themes was done by the organizers.

For WSSSPE2, the organizers wanted to increase the interactivity of the sessions, and to open the process of creating the sessions to the full program committee, the paper authors, and others who might attend the workshop.  In order to do this, the organizers decided to use a breakout format for two sessions, and to use an open process to determine the breakout topics.  Specifically, well-sorted\footnote{\url{http://www.well-sorted.org}} was used as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Authors were asked to create well-sorted ``cards'' for the papers.  These cards have a title (50 characters maximum) and a body (255 characters maximum).
\item Authors, program committee members, and members of the WSSSPE mailing list were asked to sort the cards.  Each person drags the cards, one by one, into groups.  A group can have as many cards as the person wants it to have, and it can have whatever meaning makes sense to that person.
\item Well-sorted then produces a set of averages of all the sorts, with various numbers of clusters of cards.
\end{enumerate}

The organizers then chose the sort that contained five groups as the one that felt most meaningful, then decided on names for the five groups, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploring Sustainability
\item Software Development Experiences
\item Credit \& Incentives
\item Reproducibility \& Reuse \& Sharing
\item Code Testing \& Code Review
\end{itemize}

Finally, since some of the papers were not represented by cards in the process, they were not placed in groups by the peer-grouping system, so the authors of these papers were asked which group seemed the best for their papers, and those papers were then placed in those groups.  The later sections of this paper that discuss the breakout groups include a list of the papers associated with each group.

\section{Defining Sustainability}

\todo{writing led by Dan - other contributions welcome}

In the first interactive session, the attendees divided themselves into groups to discuss software sustainability.  They were asked to
\begin{enumerate}
\item discuss what the term ``software sustainability'' meant to them
\item determine three things they considered to be significant enablers of software sustainability
\item determine three things they considered to be significant barriers to software sustainability
\end{enumerate}
Once each group had come up with answers, all the answers were compiled, and the attendees voted on which they thought were important by a show of hands.

The general responses to what software sustainability meant were:

\begin{itemize}
\item keeping software scientifically useful
\item separating techniques in code from knowledge in code
\item that an adequately large community finds value in software and is willing to sustain it
\end{itemize}

\katznote{any discussion of this?}

The enablers of and barriers to software sustainability, roughly ranked by attendee votes are shown in {\tablename}s~\ref{tb:software_sustainability_enablers} and \ref{tb:software_sustainability_barriers}, respectively.\footnote{A few other items were suggested as barriers, but were not voted on due to lack of time in the session:
layering up dependencies;
using software past its sustainable life;
using software past its usable life;
inertia for accepted answers vs wrong/right answers;
monolithic or poor code; and
need to restructure code when hardware/software/libraries change.
}

\katznote{any discussion of these tables?}

\section{Conclusions}

\todo{currently just pre-workshop stuff - needs to be updated}

The WSSSPE2 workshop continues our experiment from WSSSPE1 in how we can collaboratively build a workshop agenda.  The differences in WSSSPE2 from WSSSPE1 are in using an existing service (EasyChair) to handle submissions and reviews, rather than an ad hoc process, and using an existing service (well-sorted) to allow collaborative grouping of papers into themes by all authors, reviewers, and the community, rather than this being done in an ad hoc manner by the organizers alone.

The fact remains that contributors also want to get credit for their participation in the process.  And the workshop organizers still want to make sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded.  Ideally, there would be a service that would be able to index the contributions to the workshop, serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community.  But since there still isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to provide a record of the workshop.

After the workshop, one or more additional papers will be created that will include the discussions at the workshop.  These papers will likely have many authors, and may be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
