The Second Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and
Experiences
(WSSSPE2)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}} was
held on Sunday, 16 November 2014 in conjunction with the 2014 International
Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
(SC14)\footnote{\url{http://sc14.supercomputing.org}}.
WSSSPE2 followed a general initial workshop,
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
that was held in 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 conference, and a focused
workshop,
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}},
that was held in 2014 in conjunction with the SciPy conference.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of
software at all levels and it is critical to address challenges related to the
development, deployment, maintenance, and overall sustainability of reusable
software as well as education around software practices. These challenges can be
technological, policy based, organizational, and educational, and are of
interest to developers (the software community), users (science disciplines),
software-engineering researchers, and researchers studying the conduct of
science (science of team science, science of organizations, science of science
and innovation policy, and social science communities). The WSSSPE1 workshop
engaged the broad scientific community to identify challenges and best practices
in areas of interest for sustainable scientific software. WSSSPE2 invites the
community to propose and discuss specific mechanisms to move towards an imagined
future practice for software development and usage in science and engineering.
The workshop includes multiple mechanisms for participation, encourages team
building around solutions, and identifies risky solutions with potentially
transformative outcomes. It strongly encourages participation of early-career
students and postdoctoral researchers.

This report extends a previous report that discussed the submission, peer-review, and peer-grouping processes in detail.~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report}.  It is also based on a collaborative set
of notes taken through a google doc during the workshop.~\cite{WSSSPE2-google-notes} 
Overall, the report discusses the organization work done before the workshop (\S\ref{sec:preworkshop}), the keynotes (\S\ref{sec:keynotes}), a session on defining sustainability (\S\ref{sec:defining}), the five breakout sessions---exploring sustainability (\S\ref{sec:exploring}); software development experiences (\S\ref{sec:devel}); credit \& incentives (\S\ref{sec:credit}); reproducibility \& reuse \& sharing (\S\ref{sec:reproduce}); code testing \& code review (\S\ref{sec:code_testing})---and some conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).  The report also includes an incomplete list of attendees (Appendix \ref{sec:attendees}).

\section{Submissions, Peer-Review, and Peer-Grouping} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\note{this section is taken from \cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report}. It could be shortened.}

WSSSPE2 began with a call for papers.
Based on the goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from those involved
in software practice, ranging from initial thoughts and partial studies to
mature deployments, but focusing on papers that are intended to lead to changes,
the organizers wanted to make submission as easy as possible. The call for
papers stated:

\begin{quote}
We invite short (4-page) \textbf{actionable} papers that will lead to
improvements for sustainable software science. These papers could be a call to
action, or could provide position or experience reports on sustainable software
activities. The papers will be used by the organizing committee to design
sessions that will be highly interactive and targeted towards facilitating
action. Submitted papers should be archived by a third-party service that
provides DOIs. We encourage submitters to license their papers under a Creative
Commons license that encourages sharing and remixing, as we will combine ideas
(with attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop.
\end{quote}

The call included the following areas of interest:
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize} 
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\theenumi}.}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{1em}
\item defining software sustainability in the context of science and engineering
software
\begin{itemize}
\item how to evaluate software sustainability
\end{itemize}

\item improving the development process that leads to new software
\begin{itemize}
\item methods to develop sustainable software from the outset

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{quote}


31 submissions were received; all but one used  
arXiv\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org}} or
figshare\footnote{\url{http://figshare.com}} to self-publish their papers.

The review process was fairly standard, where reviewers bid for papers, then an
automated system
matched bids to determine assignments, and reviewers then completed their
assigned
reviews (with an average of 4.9 reviews per paper, and 4.1 reviews per
reviewer).
This process was done through EasyChair\footnote{http://easychair.org/}, which
allowed reviewers to provide scores on relevance and comments to the organizers,
which were used to decide which papers to associate with the workshop, and
comments to the authors, which were provided back to the authors to allow them
to improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 28 of the papers as significantly contributing to
the workshop, a very high acceptance rate, but one that is reasonable, given the
goal of broad participation and the fact that the reports were already
self-published.

WSSSPE1 was organized into sessions, each of which was aimed at discussing one
or more of the themes from the call for papers, with a few paper authors invited
to summarize the other papers in them as a panel, followed by general
discussion about that theme. The mapping of papers to themes was done by the
organizers.

For WSSSPE2, the organizers wanted to increase the interactivity of the
sessions, and to open the process of creating the sessions to the full program
committee, the paper authors, and others who might attend the workshop. In order
to do this, the organizers decided to use a breakout format for two sessions,
and to use an open process to determine the breakout topics. Specifically,
well-sorted\footnote{\url{http://www.well-sorted.org}} was used as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Authors were asked to create well-sorted ``cards'' for the papers. These
cards have a title (50 characters maximum) and a body (255 characters maximum).
\item Authors, program committee members, and members of the WSSSPE mailing list
were asked to sort the cards. Each person drags the cards, one by one, into
groups. A group can have as many cards as the person wants it to have, and it
can have whatever meaning makes sense to that person.
\item Well-sorted then produces a set of averages of all the sorts, with various
numbers of clusters of cards.
\end{enumerate}

The organizers then chose the sort that contained five groups as the one that
felt most meaningful, then decided on names for the five groups, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploring Sustainability
\item Software Development Experiences
\item Credit \& Incentives
\item Reproducibility \& Reuse \& Sharing
\item Code Testing \& Code Review
\end{itemize}

Finally, since some of the papers were not represented by cards in the process,
they were not placed in groups by the peer-grouping system, so the authors of
these papers were asked which group seemed the best for their papers, and those
papers were then placed in those groups. Sections~\ref{sec:exploring}-\ref{sec:code_testing}
discuss the breakout groups, including a list of the papers associated with each
group.

The workshop featured two keynote addresses. In the opening keynote
presentation, Kaitlin Thaney of the Mozilla Science Lab talked about her
organization's work and policy to enable and support sustainable and
reproducible scientific research. Our second keynote speaker was Neil Chue Hong
of Software Sustainability Institute. He shined the light on how scientific
software is prevalently driving advances in many science and engineering fields.
Both keynote speeches spawned further discussion among workshop participants on
the crucial notion ``sustainability'' in the theme of our workshop.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Kaitlin Thaney, Designing for Truth, Scale, and Sustainability}
\label{keynote1}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Kaitlin Thaney is the Director of the Mozilla Science Lab (hereafter Mozilla).
Mozilla is a non-profit organization interested in openness, in news, in website
creation, and in Science, all taking advantage of the open web. 

Thaney started noting the unfortunate fact that many current systems have been designed to create friction hindering us, despite the original intentions. \katznote{prev sentence is confusing}%---social issues hindering us
An example is the National Cancer Institute's caBIG. 
A total of \$350m was spent, including more than \$60m for management.  $70+$ tools were created, but caBIG is still seen
as a failure (Kaitlin didn't really say why? Were the tools used? Did they
immediately bit-rot? Was their development unsustained?)-should ask question
about this.
 Those that had the least investment were the most used, the largest
investments were the least used.
 Is there a caBIG report available? Quotes from Andrea Califano/Joe Gray,
looks like there is:
\url{http://tinyurl.com/maf6dz2}. %http://www.informationweek.com/architecture/report-blasts-problem-plagued-cancer-research-grid/d/d-id/1097068?

What do we mean by open research? In regard to
community/technology/practices

Inefficiency: \url{http://www.xkcd.com/1445/}. Need research tools (e.g., software repositories), social capital (e.g.,
incentives) and capacity (e.g., training and mentorship) for efficient reproducible
research.

 
Our systems need to talk to each other but Q for speaker is that as
systems become less monolithic, paradoxically it may be harder to sustain the
links between them see:
\url{http://tinyurl.com/l76tba2} %http://www.slideshare.net/jameshowison/scientific-software-sustainability-and-ecosystem-complexity
(but does Anon Grizzly have other cites/info for that?).
Note, for example, that creative commons licensed works typically do not 
have dependencies (a book, a photo, an artwork).
Software Discovery Index: \url{http://softwarediscoveryindex.org/report/}.

 Final points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design with the audience not the individual in mind
\item Design to unlock latent potential of our systems
\item Rethink how we reward researchers and support roles
\item By mindful of jargon/semantics traps
\end{itemize}

Questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ted Habermann: if the metadata is minimal less onerous for data provider,
but more onerous for user. How to work with data providers to show that users
need more.
\item Find balance between things that have to be captured and what would be
ideal. Don't want to get to point where like old Harvard Dataverse, three pages
of metadata capture, only first four things ever filled out. Don't want to lose
engagement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Defining Sustainability} \label{sec:defining}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\todo{writing led by Dan - other contributions welcome}

In the first interactive session, the attendees divided themselves into groups
to discuss software sustainability. They were asked to
\begin{enumerate}
\item discuss what the term ``software sustainability'' meant to them

\item determine three things they considered to be significant enablers of
software sustainability

\item determine three things they considered to be significant barriers to
software sustainability
\end{enumerate}
Once each group had come up with answers, all the answers were compiled, and the
attendees voted on which they thought were important by a show of hands.

The general responses to what software sustainability meant were:
\begin{itemize}
\item keeping software scientifically useful
\item separating techniques in code from knowledge in code
\item that an adequately large community finds value in software and is willing
to sustain it
\end{itemize}

\katznote{any discussion of this?}

The enablers of and barriers to software sustainability, roughly ranked by
attendee votes are shown in
{\tablename}s~\ref{tb:software_sustainability_enablers} and
\ref{tb:software_sustainability_barriers}, respectively.\footnote{A few other
items were suggested as barriers, but were not voted on due to lack of time in
the session:
layering up dependencies;
using software past its sustainable life;
using software past its usable life;
inertia for accepted answers vs wrong/right answers;
monolithic or poor code; and
need to restructure code when hardware/software/libraries change.
}

This group, with just three papers but a large amount of interest and participation from attendees,
focused on the institutional, social, and cultural mechanisms encourage the creation
and maintenance of shared software, in the context of what now exists but focusing
on what mechanisms are desired and how we might achieve them.


%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Discussion and Actions}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the first discussion session, this group decided to break into two smaller groups,
each independently working through the same general topic: credit and incentives.

\subsubsection{First breakout discussion: Group A}
The first sub-group discussed around the current system for credit and current incentives,
which it called ``hacking the incentive structure''.  The group considered four potential
points of leverage:

First, that we currently have systems that collect information, and these could be modified
to collect different information, then map that information to actions. We could
initially build a proof-of-concept for a new use of a given system, then determine
what actions would be needed to make this use more common.

Second that we could create entirely new systems, perhaps because the existing
systems are too tied to what they measure, and modifying them is not practical.

Third that we could change academic culture, rather than worrying about the systems.
This was mostly focused on citations, because they matter for hiring, promotion,
and tenure decisions.  The group discussed how we could weight the citations
within papers better than we now do? How could we identify the five citations
that really matter for a paper, distinguishing them from the related works and
general background that are also cited.  Perhaps we could break these out in
the reference list, working with publishers to implement this.  Or maybe we
could also break out categories of citations, such as the most important software used,
the previous publication that we are building from, the data that we actually used, etc.
The Moore Foundation's award in data science was given as an example, asking
proposers: What are the five canonical citations that are most important to your work?
This would be a way of giving credit and assigning importance to these works,
differently from how we just count citations today.  A possible action that the group
discussed was conducting a longitudinal study of most useful \{software, data, etc.\}
in a discipline

Fourth, that we could change the ways funders make decisions, and use these funding
policies as incentives.

After this discussion, group A brainstormed about incentives,
with the following items suggested:
\begin{itemize}
\item running programming contests, creating bounties for contributing to open source software, etc.
\item augment author lists to give credit to people who don't now get credit (and making them machine readable)
\item developing a microcitation standard and mechanism (for both software and data)
\item developing a well-defined standard for author contribution -- what level of contribution rises to the level of authorship?
\item leveraging social media for citation and reviewing of content -- then using social media to bring more people into the review process than is traditional
\item determining where else software can be cited and recorded (e.g., acknowledgments sections of papers)
\item developing a taxonomy of contributors, tied to places that these metrics are already stored (e.g., ORCID)
\item making metadata more easy to add for software, creating incentive for providing software metadata -- note that this cannot be centralized
\item creating something like the h-index that tenure committees can make use of - simplify a way of measuring and documenting the overall credit given to an individual over different projects
\item thinking about publishing software vs journal - software does not have to be novel
\item determining guidelines for recommending software characteristics for tenure - perhaps draft guidelines then get ACM or IEEE agreement
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{First breakout discussion: Group B}

This group started by discussing who should be incentivized, thinking of two categories of people:  
those in science (who could be incentivized to do better, more shareable, more sustainable work), and
those in industry but interested in science (who could be incentivized to contribute to science.)  It was pointed out that we are not yet clear enough on exactly what we want to incentivize, suggesting that we need to have a clearer picture of ``good computational work" and what sort of contributions are truly generative for science.

The discussion of incentivizing those in science acknowledged that the publications system was far from perfect for incentivizing good software work.
Nonetheless discussion focused on bringing software people into publications. There were two main suggestions.
The first is to focus on end users of software and encourage them to cite software the ``right" way. \katznote{what is the second?}
James Howison suggested that his research showed that few projects were making a formal request for citation (but that authors weren't necessarily following those suggestions anyway) \katznote{add cite?}; he suggested making access to the software conditional on a license that requires citation.
Others found this ``too confrontational" and preferred to concentrate on making it easier to do the right thing.
The group was more enthusiastic about ``forcing" PIs to include their ``software people" on publications, although there were few ideas on how exactly to do this.
Another technique mentioned was that when scientific software projects are hosted in organizations like Apache, the scientific contributors can benefit from building their reputations, perhaps yielding job offers that they can use to negotiate better job and career packages.

The discussion on incentivizing those outside science focused on accessing the well of affection that those working in software have for scientific research.
How can the interest and skills of this group be marshaled towards sustainable contributions?
The is evidence that the migration of scientific software projects to the Apache Foundation has created opportunities for those not employed in the scientific center to contribute to projects initiated by scientists (especially where there is cross-over with industry needs, such as provenance and workflow).

The group also discussed developing ``software prizes" arguing that while it is hard to ``mint" other new sources of reputation, prizes are possible without getting too many others on board.
The prize criteria can form a template for describing what we mean by scientific contributions made through software, particularly focusing on building active communities, not only writing great code. 

\subsubsection{Group merger and redivision}

After the first breakout session, the groups A and B came together and discussed 
a rollup of the ideas from the subgroups at a high level:
\begin{itemize}
\item citation ecosystem - traces of usage (metrics)
\item taxonomy of contributorship, understanding roles
\item prizes
\item new metrics (for people's activities in software)
\item guidelines for evaluating scientific contribution through software (perhaps using new metrics)
\end{itemize}

In the remaining discussion sessions, the group chose to split into three subgroups to discuss
a version of these topics: {\em citation ecosystems},
{\em taxonomy of contributorship/guidelines for software for tenure review}, and {\em prizes}.  The subgroups were asked to clearly identify
\begin{itemize}
\item the problem to be solved
\item steps towards a solution
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Remaining breakout discussions: Citation ecosystems}

%https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOja7k0mXwvOB2tQD3ZW3O38Qv4NwfA21zdMQ9JlUQc/edit

This group defined its goal as creating a low-barrier-of-entry method for recording names and roles (and in a second phase, optionally including weights) of contributors (coders and other intellectual contributions) to a software package in a machine readable way (to be called a credit file), then encouraging the scientific community to adopt this practice. 

The following general points were initially discussed: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The FLASH project was suggested as an example of how something like this has been done.
\item This data could be a file that can be associated with a citation to the software, either through use of a DOI for the credit file, or by uploading the credit files as associated with the paper.
\item This idea could also be applied to data
\item This data (the credit file) should be part of the metadata that is outside of paywalls, like citations are now.
\item It was suggested that there should also be a separate file to track software dependencies, but this is not the same file.
\end{itemize} 

The group came up with the following actions to be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build a tool that can automatically determine who the contributors are (from a git or other repo), then allows the user to manually edit the output to add/remove people, define roles. 
\item Work with repositories to encourage them to provide the information we need based on what they already store.
\item Define what a citation file should look like and what it should be called.
\item Test adoption, for example, with LBNL.
\item Create credit file for a set of software.
\item Build a validator (and perhaps a visualizer) for credit files.
\item Write a tool to collect files and visualize/output interconnections (which software is used with which), based on an existing project.
\item When we (the group members) write papers, we should track the software we use, and encourage the software developers to make their software citable and create credit files.
\item Build a tool to export the credit file to BibTex and other citation styles.
\item Make sure the BibTex entries (exported from internal data) are somewhat standardized so that they can be imported into papers.  Also make sure that standard LaTex style files understand and accept these entries.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\todo{currently just pre-workshop stuff - needs to be updated}

The WSSSPE2 workshop continues our experiment from WSSSPE1 in how we can
collaboratively build a workshop agenda. The differences in WSSSPE2 from WSSSPE1
are in using an existing service (EasyChair) to handle submissions and reviews,
rather than an ad hoc process, and using an existing service (well-sorted) to
allow collaborative grouping of papers into themes by all authors, reviewers,
and the community, rather than this being done in an ad hoc manner by the
organizers alone.

The fact remains that contributors also want to get credit for their
participation in the process. And the workshop organizers still want to make
sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded. Ideally, there
would be a service that would be able to index the contributions to the
workshop, serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community. But
since there still isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are
writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to
provide a record of the workshop.

After the workshop, one or more additional papers will be created that will
include the discussions at the workshop. These papers will likely have many
authors, and may be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
