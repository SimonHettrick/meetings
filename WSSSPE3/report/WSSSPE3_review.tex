\todo{need to update this abstract for WSSSPE3}
This technical report records and discusses the Second Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2). 
%The workshop used an
%alternative submission and peer-review process, which led to a set of papers
%divided across five topic areas: 
The report includes a description of the alternative, experimental submission
and review process, two workshop keynote presentations, a series of lightning
talks, a discussion on sustainability, and five discussions from the topic areas
of exploring sustainability; software development experiences; credit \&
incentives; reproducibility \& reuse \& sharing; and code testing \& code
review. For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change.
%
The workshop recognized that reliance on scientific software
is pervasive in all areas of world-leading research today. The workshop
participants then proceeded to explore different perspectives on the concept of
sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of sustainable scientific software
were identified from their experiences. In addition,
recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files and software
prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in sustainable software
engineering.
%
There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education
programs.
%
Finally, journals can define and publish policies to improve reproducibility, whereas
reviewers can insist that authors provide sufficient information and access to
data and software to allow them reproduce the results in the paper. Hence a list of
criteria is compiled for  journals to provide to reviewers so as to make it easier to
review software submitted for publication as a ``Software Paper.''

The Third Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE3)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/}} was
held on 28--29 September 2015 in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Previous events in the
WSSSPE series are
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
held in conjunction with SC13,
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized in July 2014 jointly with the SciPy
conference\footnote{\url{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/wssspe/}},
WSSSPE2\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}}~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report,WSSSPE2},
held in conjunction with SC14, and
WSSSPE2.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized in July 2015 again jointly with
SciPy\footnote{\url{http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/286469/}}.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of
software at all levels. Hence it is critical to address challenges related to
the development, deployment, maintenance, and overall sustainability of reusable
software as well as education around software practices. These challenges can be
technological, policy based, organizational, and educational, and are of
interest to developers (the software community), users (science disciplines),
software-engineering researchers, and researchers studying the conduct of
science (science of team science, science of organizations, science of science
and innovation policy, and social science communities). The WSSSPE1 workshop
engaged the broad scientific community to identify challenges and best practices
in areas of interest to creating sustainable scientific software. WSSSPE2
invited the community to propose and discuss specific mechanisms to move towards
an imagined future practice for software development and usage in science and
engineering, but WSSSPE2 didn't have a good way to enact those mechanisms, or to
encourage the attendees to follow through on their intentions.

The workshop included multiple mechanisms for participation and encouraged team
building around solutions. It strongly encouraged participation of early-career
scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, with funds provided
to the conference organizers by the Moore Foundation, the National Science
Foundation (NSF), and the Software Sustainability Institute, to support the
travel of potential participants who would not otherwise be able to attend,
early-stage researchers, and those from underrepresented groups. These funds allowed
16 additional participants to attend.

This report is based on collaborative notes taken with during the workshop,
which were linked from the GitHub issues that represented the potential and
actual working
groups\footnote{\url{https://github.com/issues?q=label\%3A\%22WSSSPE3+activity\%22}}.
Overall, the report discusses the organization work done before the workshop
(\S\ref{sec:preworkshop}); the keynotes (\S\ref{sec:keynote}); a series of
lightning talks (\S\ref{sec:lightning}), intended to give an opportunity for
attendees to quickly highlight an important issue or a potential solution. The
report also gives summaries of action plans proposed by the eleven working
groups (\S\ref{sec:WGs}), and some conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).
Lists of the organizing committee (Appendix~\ref{sec:orgcom}), the registered
attendees (Appendix~\ref{sec:attendees}), and the travel award recipients
(Appendix~\ref{sec:awardees}) are provided. Finally, the report includes longer
descriptions of the activities that
occurred in each of the working groups that made substantial progress 
(Appendices~\ref{sec:appendix_best_practices}--\ref{sec:appendix_user_community}).

\section{Calls for Participation} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE3 was based on the work done in WSSSPE1 and WSSSPE2, but aimed at starting
a process to make progress in sustainable software, as the calls for
participation said:

\begin{quote} The WSSSPE1 workshop engaged the broad scientific community to
identify challenges and best practices in areas relevant to sustainable
scientific software. WSSSPE2 invited the community to propose and discuss
specific mechanisms to move towards an imagined future practice of software
development and usage in science and engineering. WSSSPE3 will organize
self-directed teams that will collaborate prior to and during the workshop to
create vision documents, proposals, papers, and action plans that will help the
scientific software community produce software that is more sustainable,
including developing sustainable career paths for community members. These teams
are intended to lead into working groups that will be active after the workshop,
if appropriate, working collaboratively to achieve their goals, and seeking
funding to do so if needed. \end{quote}

The first call for participation requested lightning talks, where authors could
make a brief statement about work that either had been done or was needed, with
the goal of contributing to the discussion of one or more working groups. There
was 24 lightning talks submitted, and, after a peer-review process, 16 of these
were accepted, as discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:lightning}.

The first call also discussed the potential action topics that came out of
WSSSPE2, and requested additional suggestions. The combination of existing and
new topics led to the following 18 potential topics that were advertised in the
call for participation:

\section{Keynote \note{Lead: S.-C. Choi.  See \href{http://tinyurl.com/qbbqgsj}{slides} \& \href{http://tinyurl.com/q45kfcn}{video}.}} \label{sec:keynote} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE3 began with a keynote speech delivered by Professor Matthew Turk from the
Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois titled \emph{Why Sustain
Scientific Software?}. Turk is a prolific scientific software practitioner and
has extensive experiences working on large collaborative projects employing
modern computing tools. He also co-organizes and champions WSSSPE events.

In his keynote address, Turk recapped the course of development of WSSSPE
workshops over the past few years, alongside his career development from a
postdoc to an academic. The first WSSSPE workshop was at the Supercomputing
conference (SC13) in 2013, but he observed that the notion of sustainable
scientific software drew in an audience beyond supercomputing. In the following
year, WSSSPE1.1 at SciPy had speakers talking about how software has been
sustained inside the scientific Python community. WSSSPE2 at SC14 had breakout
group discussions coming up with actionable items, and WSSSPE2.1 at SciPy 2015
was similar. Turk noted the different atmosphere of the surrounding large
conferences, despite similar WSSSPE participants.

WSSSPE3 left the traditional Supercomputing Conference environment this year,
and in Turk's words, this spoke to the fact that scientific software comes from
many different types of inquiries, deployment, strategies for maintenance,
users, and ways of measuring the value of a piece of software. It appeared to
Turk that the supercomputing community generally adopt some top-down approaches,
whereas the SciPy community more often than not uses more bottom-up systems. The
essential messages perceived were also often bipolar: the supercomputing
community thinks software is getting harder, with exascale computing and
optimization issues in mind, but the SciPy community thinks software becoming
better, with emerging tools such as Jupiter and productivity packages for
research workflow. Admitting such comparisons are somewhat unfair
generalizations, Turk reminded the audience that the different approaches bring
different types of ideas to the table, and he welcomed WSSSPE3 being conducted
outside existing preconceptions.

Returning to the topic of his talk, Turk invited the audience to picture
scientific software as a flower on a landscape under the Sun, which may
represent a number of measurable factors such as number of citations; growth of
a community and number of contributors; amount of funding; prestigious prizes
awarded; stability of the community in terms of leadership transitions, serving
community needs, not breaking test suites, and performance on new architectures.
But all these metrics are strictly speaking \emph{proxies} for the values and
the impact scientific software bears. What we can measure does not give us
direct insight---it just gives us proxies of insight.
  
Turk then moved onto various different definitions of sustainability. His
favorite one was `keeping up with bug reports,' where even if no new features
were added, the software remains sustainable. Another definition of
sustainability Turk mentioned was `adding of new features', or `maintaining the
software for a long period of time' such as the cases of TeX or LaTeX with
community help. A notion Turk heard often at supercomputing conferences was that
sustainable software `continues to work on new architectures'. Yet another
metric was `people continuing to be able to learn how to use and apply the
software'. A funder Turk heard talked about sustainability as `continuing to get
funded'. Turk also recalled that Greg Wilson, among others, said in WSSSPE1.1
that his view of sustainable software was software that `continued to give the
same results over time'. A last measure of sustainability Turk presented was
`the ability to transition between different people developing and using a piece
of software.'

At WSSSPE1, several models were presented for ensuring sustainability. Turk
considered that a familiar one was a funded piece of software where an external
agency provided funds to a group who are not necessarily exclusively working on
and developing a piece of software, keeps it going, and provides it to the
scientific community. The model of productized software, in which a piece of
software has grown into something that individuals rely on to the point that
research groups or people are willing to support it with some amount of funding,
for instance, a subscription to use cloud services that deploy a piece of
software, or purchase of a piece of software. A final model Turk felt conflicted
about is a volunteer model that is traditional old-school---not modern-day open
source---development.

Turk discussed whether productizing scientific software was synonymous with
being sustainable and self-sufficient. He thought it was not necessarily the
case and furthermore, it could lead to a divergence of interest between users
and developers.

Turk reminded the audience that the volunteer model means unpaid labor. On this
note, he recommended Ashe Dryden's blog post on the
ethics of unpaid labor and the open source software
community\footnote{http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community}.
Often times, a person
funded to work full time on a scientific project can spend a small amount of
time for working on a piece of software necessary for that project. However, all
researchers' ability to participate in that volunteer community are not always
the same and may not always be aligned with their research projects. From Turk's
experience, we cannot always rely on unpaid labor and volunteer time to sustain
a piece of software---this came down to the notions of the top-down and the
bottom-up approaches, i.e., the funded versus the grassroots. However, Turk
pointed out that bottom-up, volunteer-driven projects can be just as large
as a top-down software development project.

Turk said that sustaining scientific software really meant to him conducting
scientific inquiries, often by some specific software, and sustaining the people
we care about, our careers, and the future of our fields. According to Turk, we
all have an invested stake in sustaining scientific software. Hence, having
``sustained'' projects can suffocate new projects, so we need to make sure
we don't cause novel ideas and packages to suffer at the hands of the status quo.
%This is a straw man concept, but it's something to look out for, since organizations will act in their own interest.

Turk talked about possible reasons why we want to sustain scientific
software: devotion to science and interests in pursuing the next stage of
research; fun and creative thrill in writing codes and papers; usefulness with
measurable impacts, for example, LINPACK and HDF groups providing of data
storage to satellites, which goes beyond usefulness to necessity. Lastly, Turk
presented his wishlist of questions to be answered in the future: 
%
\begin{itemize} 

\item How do we ship a product on time when dealing with a mix of funding models
and motivations especially when we rely on volunteers?

\item How do we know when it is time to end some software and move on? For
example, should we stop sustaining Python and switch to Julia and Javascript?
 
\item How can productized software balance its future versus its past, or the new
needs of the customers versus the existing needs of the development community?

\item How can we help avoid burnout and retain the joy in the communities?

\item How can we reduce systemic bias, which goes back to the blog post of
Dryden especially on how ethics of unpaid labor disproportionately affect
underrepresented communities?

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Benjamin Tovar and Douglas Thain: \textit{Freedom vs. Stability:
Facilitating Research Training While Supporting Scientific Research}}
A case study: ``The Cooperative Computing Lab'' at the University of Notre Dame
is a small group of individuals whose main tasks are collaborating with
people that have large-scale computing problems, operating various parallel
computer systems, conducting computer science research, and developing open
source software. One of the main challenges they face is finding the balance
between flexibility/training and stability/quality. Their current solution for
ensuring the latter was to add a software engineer (the presenter) to the
existing team of faculty and students, who now also serves as ``spring''
between flexibility and stability.

\item \textbf{Birgit Penzenstadler, Colin Venters, Christoph Becker, Stefanie
Betz, Ruzanna Chitchyan, Let\'{i}cia Duboc, Steve Easterbrook, Guillermo
Rodriguez-Navas and Norbert Seyff: \textit{Manifesting the Ghost of the Future:
Sustainability}}
The concept of sustainability has become a topic of interest in the field of
computing, which is evidenced by the increase in the number of events that
focus on the topic. Nevertheless, it isn't well understood yet. Penzenstadler
argued that we often define sustainability too narrowly. Instead,
sustainability at its heart is a systemic concept and must be viewed from a
range of different dimensions including environmental, economic, individual,
social and technical. She introduced the Karlskrona Manifesto on Software
Design~\cite{Becker:2014}, which distills knowledge from a broad range of related work on the
topic of sustainability into a set of (mis-)perceptions and principles. The
manifesto does not proclaim that there is an easy, one-size-fits-all solution
around the corner, but rather points out that sustainability is a ``wicked
problem'' and is often misunderstood. Due to these misperceptions, even though
sustainability's importance is increasingly recognized, many software systems
are unsustainable. Even more alarming is that most software systems' broader
impacts on sustainability are unknown. To change this, the Karlskrona Manifesto
proposes nine principles and commitments. These commitments are not dogmatic
laws, but rather a commitment to rethink, to move beyond the silo mentality,
and analyze in more depth. As such, they do not restrict, but rather open up a
space for discussion.

\item \textbf{Abani Patra, Hossein Aghakhani, Nikolay Simakov, Matthew D. Jones
and Tevfik Kosar: \textit{Integrating New Functionality Using Smart Interfaces to
Improve Productivity of Legacy Tools}}
Abani Patra presented an example how the community using Titan2d, a Geoflow
Simulation Software, increased the productivity of their tools by improving
both code and data layout. Main obstacles in this change were the non-existence
of a common version control system for the source code, coupled with multiple
versions of the same code base, the fixed format of input files, that many
input values used to be set as compilation flags, and that the internal data
layout was not suitable for modern technologies (vectorization, accelerators).
The approach of the Titan2d developers included reinforcing the code structure
using a multiple laters of Python and C++, and a redesign of the data layout to
be better suitable for modern CPUs and accelerators.

\item \textbf{Jeffrey Carver: \textit{On the Need for Software Engineering Support for
Sustainable Scientic Software}}
Jeff argued that for scientific software to be truly sustainable, there is a need
for developers to use appropriate software engineering practices. His experience
interacting with scientific teams indicates that choosing and tailoring these
practices is not a trivial exercise. There is a general culture clash between
software engineering and science that hinders our ability to communicate and
choose appropriate methods. In addition, many experience scientific software
developers appear to be unaware of software engineering practices that may be
beneficial to them. The most appropriate software engineering practices are
those that are lightweight, properly tailored, and focus on the key software
development problems faced by scientists. In order to increase the use of
software engineering in science, we need more documented success stories. These
successes need to be socialized within the scientific community through
workshops like the Software Engineering for Science workshop
series\footnote{\href{http://www.SE4Science.org/workshops}{http://www.SE4Science.org/workshops}}
and the new Software Engineering track in
\textit{Computing in Science and Engineering} magazine.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In WSSSPE3, we attempted to take what we learned from WSSSPE1 and WSSSPE2
in how we can collaboratively build a workshop agenda and turn that into
an ongoing community activity.  The success or failure of this effort
of this will only become apparent over time.

The workshop had two components, presentations and working groups.  The presentations,
in the first half day of the workshop, including a inspirational keynote and a set of lightning
talks.
We used lightning talks for two reasons: first, the need of some participants to have a slot
on the agenda to justify their attendance, and second, as a way to get new ideas across
to all the attendees.  We broke with the tradition of requiring the lightning talk submitters
to self-publish their papers, and instead used a common peer-review platform\footnote{\url{http://easychair.org}}, choosing to publish the speaker slides on the workshop web site
instead.

The working groups met for a small part of the first half day and all of the second day,
excepting some times for the groups to report back to the collected workshop attendees.
\todo{need to say some more about what came of this}

\todo{this paragraph is from the wssspe2 report - to be updated...}
However, the challenge that we have discovered
since WSSSPE2 is that it is very hard to continue the breakout groups'
activities.  The WSSSPE2 participants were willing to dedicate their time to
the groups while they were at the meeting, but afterwards, they have gone
back to their (paid) jobs.  We need to determine how to tie the WSSSPE
breakout activities to people's jobs, so that they feel that continuing them
is a higher priority than it is now, perhaps through funding the participants,
or through funding coordinators for each activity, or perhaps by getting
the workshop participants to agree to a specific schedule of activities during the
workshop.

%WSSSPE actively used the online social network Twitter, with hashtag
%``\#WSSSPE''. There were substantially more tweets (messages) during the days of
%the workshops WSSSPE2, WSSSPE1.1, and WSSSPE1. Out of about 670 tweets as of Apr
%18, 2015, more than 225 were about WSSSPE2 and about 180 were posted during the
%day of the workshop. Some of the main points and highlights in the meeting are
%shown in Table~\ref{tab:tweets}, which summarizes the top \#WSSSPE tweets from
%the day of workshop, selected by the metrics that number of retweets or
%favorites larger than five and the sum of two measures greater than ten.
