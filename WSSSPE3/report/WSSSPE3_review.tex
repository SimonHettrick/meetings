\todo{need to update this abstract for WSSSPE3}
This technical report records and discusses the Second Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2). 
%The workshop used an
%alternative submission and peer-review process, which led to a set of papers
%divided across five topic areas: 
The report includes a description of the alternative, experimental submission
and review process, two workshop keynote presentations, a series of lightning
talks, a discussion on sustainability, and five discussions from the topic areas
of exploring sustainability; software development experiences; credit \&
incentives; reproducibility \& reuse \& sharing; and code testing \& code
review. For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change.
%
The workshop recognized that reliance on scientific software
is pervasive in all areas of world-leading research today. The workshop
participants then proceeded to explore different perspectives on the concept of
sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of sustainable scientific software
were identified from their experiences. In addition,
recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files and software
prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in sustainable software
engineering.
%
There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education
programs.
%
Finally, journals can define and publish policies to improve reproducibility, whereas
reviewers can insist that authors provide sufficient information and access to
data and software to allow them reproduce the results in the paper. Hence a list of
criteria is compiled for  journals to provide to reviewers so as to make it easier to
review software submitted for publication as a ``Software Paper.''

The Third Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE3)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/}} was
held on 28-29 September 2015 in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Previous events in the
WSSSPE series are
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
held in conjunction with SC13,
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized in July 2014 jointly with the SciPy
conference\footnote{\url{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/wssspe/}},
WSSSPE2\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}}~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report,WSSSPE2},
held in conjunction with SC14, and
WSSSPE2.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized in July 2015 again jointly with
SciPy\footnote{\url{http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/286469/}}.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of
software at all levels. Hence it is critical to address challenges related to
the development, deployment, maintenance, and overall sustainability of reusable
software as well as education around software practices. These challenges can be
technological, policy based, organizational, and educational, and are of
interest to developers (the software community), users (science disciplines),
software-engineering researchers, and researchers studying the conduct of
science (science of team science, science of organizations, science of science
and innovation policy, and social science communities). The WSSSPE1 workshop
engaged the broad scientific community to identify challenges and best practices
in areas of interest to creating sustainable scientific software. WSSSPE2
invited the community to propose and discuss specific mechanisms to move towards
an imagined future practice for software development and usage in science and
engineering, but WSSSPE2 didn't have a good way to enact those mechanisms, or to
encourage the attendees to follow through on their intentions.

The workshop included multiple mechanisms for participation and encouraged team
building around solutions. It strongly encouraged participation of early-career
scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, with funds provided
to the conference organizers by the Moore Foundation, the National Science
Foundation (NSF), and the Software Sustainability Institute, to support the
travel of potential participants who would not otherwise be able to attend,
younger participants and those from underrepresented groups. These funds allowed
16 additional participants to attend.

This report is based on collaborative notes taken with during the workshop,
which were linked from the GitHub issues that represented the potential and
actual working
groups\footnote{\url{https://github.com/issues?q=label\%3A\%22WSSSPE3+activity\%22}}.
Overall, the report discusses the organization work done before the workshop
(\S\ref{sec:preworkshop}); the keynotes (\S\ref{sec:keynote}); a series of
lightning talks (\S\ref{sec:lightning}), intended to give an opportunity for
attendees to quickly highlight an important issue or a potential solution. The
report also gives summaries of action plans proposed by the eleven working
groups (\S\ref{sec:WGs}), and some conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).
Finally, the report includes a list of registered attendees
(Appendix~\ref{sec:attendees}) and longer descriptions of the activities that
occurred in each the working groups
(Appendices~\ref{sec:appendix_best_practices}-\ref{sec:appendix_user_community}.)

\section{Calls for Participation} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE3 was based on the work done in WSSSPE1 and WSSSPE2, but aimed at starting
a process to make progress in sustainable software, as the calls for
participation said:

\begin{quote} The WSSSPE1 workshop engaged the broad scientific community to
identify challenges and best practices in areas relevant to sustainable
scientific software. WSSSPE2 invited the community to propose and discuss
specific mechanisms to move towards an imagined future practice of software
development and usage in science and engineering. WSSSPE3 will organize
self-directed teams that will collaborate prior to and during the workshop to
create vision documents, proposals, papers, and action plans that will help the
scientific software community produce software that is more sustainable,
including developing sustainable career paths for community members. These teams
are intended to lead into working groups that will be active after the workshop,
if appropriate, working collaboratively to achieve their goals, and seeking
funding to do so if needed. \end{quote}

The first call for participation requested lightning talks, where authors could
make a brief statement about work that either had been done or was needed, with
the goal of contributing to the discussion of one or more working groups. There
was 24 lightning talks submitted, and after a peer-review process, 16 of these
were accepted, as discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:lightning}.

The first call also discussed the potential action topics that came out of
WSSSPE2, and requested additional suggestions. The combination of existing and
new topics led to the following 18 potential topics that were advertised in the
call for participation:


\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\theenumi}.}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{1em}

\item Development and Community
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing a white paper/review paper about best practices in developing
sustainable software
\item Documenting successful models for funding specialist expertise in software
collaborations
\item Creating and curating catalogs for software tools that aid sustainability
(perhaps categorized by domain, programming languages, architectures, and/or
functions, e.g., for code testing, documentation)
\item Documenting case studies for academia/industry interaction
\item Determining effective strategies for refactoring/improving legacy
scientific software
\item Determining principles for engineering design for sustainable software
\item Create a set of guidance giving examples of specific metrics for the
success of scientific software in use, why they were chosen, what they are
useful to measure, and any challenges/pitfalls; then publish this as a white
paper
\end{itemize}

\item Training
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing a white paper on training for developing sustainable software, and
coordinating multiple ongoing training-oriented projects
\item Developing curriculum for software sustainability, and ideas about where
such curriculum would be presented, such as a summer training institute
\end{itemize}

\item Credit
\begin{itemize}
\item Hacking the credit and citation ecosystem (making it work, or work better,
for software)
\item Developing a taxonomy of contributorship/guidelines for including software
contributions in tenure review
\item Documenting case studies of receiving credit for software contributions
\item Developing a system of awards and recognitions to encourage sustainable software
\end{itemize}

\item Publishing
\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a categorization of journals that publish software papers
(building on existing work), and case studies of alternative publishing
mechanisms that have been shown to improve software discoverability/reuse e.g.,
popular blogs/websites
\item Determining what journals that publish software paper should provide to
their reviewers (e.g., guidelines, mechanisms, metadata standards, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\item Reproducibility and Testing
\begin{itemize}
\item Building a toolkit that could allow conference organizers to easily add a
reproducibility track
\item Documenting best practices for code testing and code review
\end{itemize}

\item Documentation
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop landing pages on the WSSSPE website (or elsewhere) that enable the
community to easily find up-to-date information on a WSSSPE topic (e.g.,
software credit, scientific software metrics, testing scientific software)
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

WSSSPE3 began with a keynote speech delivered by Professor Matthew
Turk from the Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois titled \emph{Why
Sustain Scientific Software?}. Turk is a prolific practitioner of scientific
software and has extensive experiences working on large collaborative projects
employing modern computing tools. He is also a co-organizer and champion of all
the WSSSPE events so far.

In his keynote address, Turk recapped the course of development of WSSSPE
workshops alongside with his career from a postdoc to an academic over the past
few years. The first WSSSPE workshop was at the Supercomputing conference (SC13)
in 2013, but he observed that the notion of sustainable scientific software drew
in an audience beyond supercomputing. In the following year, WSSSPE1.1 at SciPy
had speakers talking about how software has been sustained inside the scientific
Python community. WSSSPE2 at SC14 had breakout group discussions coming up with
actionable items, and WSSSPE2.1 at SciPy 2015 was similar. Turk noted the
different atmosphere of the surrounding large conferences, despite similar
WSSSPE participants. 

WSSSPE3 broke free of the traditional Supercomputing Conference
environment this year, and in Turk's words, it spoke to the fact that scientific
software comes from many different types of inquiries, deployment, strategies
for maintenance, users; and ways of measuring the value of a piece of software.
It appeared to Turk that the supercomputing conferences generally adopt some
top-down approaches, whereas SciPy generally uses more bottom-up systems.
The essential messages
perceived were also often circumpolar: \katznote{this means ``situated around or inhabiting one of the earth's poles'' - not sure this is the right word} software getting harder in supercomputing
communities with exascale computing and optimization issues in mind, but software becoming better in the
SciPy group with emerging tools such as Jupiter and productivity packages for research workflow.
Admitting such comparisons are somewhat unfair generalizations, Turk reminded the
audience that the different approaches bring different types of ideas to the
table, but he welcomed WSSSPE3 being conducted outside existing preconceptions.

\todo{need to update for WSSSPE3}
The WSSSPE2 workshop continued our experiment from WSSSPE1 in how we can
collaboratively build a workshop agenda, and we began a new experiment in
how to build a series of workshops into an ongoing community activity.

The differences in workshop organization in WSSSPE2 from WSSSPE1
are in using an existing service (EasyChair) to handle submissions and reviews,
rather than an ad hoc process, and using an existing service (Well Sorted) to
allow collaborative grouping of papers into themes by all authors, reviewers,
and the community, rather than this being done in an ad hoc manner by the
organizers alone.

The fact remains that contributors also want to get credit for their
participation in the process. And the workshop organizers will want to make
sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded. Ideally, there
would be a service that would index the contributions to the
workshop, serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community. 
Since there still isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are
writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to
provide a record of the workshop.

WSSSPE actively used the online social network Twitter, with hashtag
``\#WSSSPE''. There were substantially more tweets (messages) during the days of
the workshops WSSSPE2, WSSSPE1.1, and WSSSPE1. Out of about 670 tweets as of Apr
18, 2015, more than 225 were about WSSSPE2 and about 180 were posted during the
day of the workshop. Some of the main points and highlights in the meeting are
shown in Table~\ref{tab:tweets}, which summarizes the top \#WSSSPE tweets from
the day of workshop, selected by the metrics that number of retweets or
favorites larger than five and the sum of two measures greater than ten.

In terms of building community activities, we wanted to focus primarily on
working groups, which we were able to do, as discussed above, but we
also wanted to make sure that attendees felt they had a chance to get their
ideas across to the whole group, which was the purpose of the lightning talks.
Overall, this seemed to be successful at the time, in terms of both the lightning
talks and the breakout groups, and the discussion of sustainability also led
to interesting and useful results. However, the challenge that we have discovered
since WSSSPE2 is that it is very hard to continue the breakout groups'
activities.  The WSSSPE2 participants were willing to dedicate their time to
the groups while they were at the meeting, but afterwards, they have gone
back to their (paid) jobs.  We need to determine how to tie the WSSSPE
breakout activities to people's jobs, so that they feel that continuing them
is a higher priority than it is now, perhaps through funding the participants,
or through funding coordinators for each activity, or perhaps by getting
the workshop participants to agree to a specific schedule of activities during the
workshop.
