\subsection{Summary of Discussion}
Software engineering principles form the basis of methods, techniques, methodologies and tools. This group discussed the principles of software engineering design for sustainable software and their application in various domains. 

\subsection{Description of Opportunity, Challenges, and Obstacles}
The opportunity was identified to distill existing software engineering and sustainability design knowledge into ''bite sized'' chunks for the Computational Science and Engineering Community. In addition, two primary challenges were identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mapping of the principles to best practice.
\item Demonstrating the return on investment of those best practices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Next Steps}

\subsection{Plan for Future Organization}
The following plan for future organization was discussed:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item Organizing coordinating online calls via Google Hangout.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What Else is Needed?}
The following list of what else is required :

\begin{itemize}
\item Ethic committee approval required for data collection.
\item 
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Milestones and Responsible Parties}
The following key milestones were discussed as a roadmap for the set of guidelines on software engineering principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Oct/Nov 2015: Study design and interview guideline
\item Jan/Feb 2016: Interviews conducted and transcribed
\item Mar/Apr 2016: Analysis complete
\item May 2016: Report written
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description of Funding Needed}
Specific funding was not discussed in this working group. However, this is a open topic that can be be discussed in relation to emerging funding calls from National agencies or grant proposal initatives.
