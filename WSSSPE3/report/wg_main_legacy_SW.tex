\subsection{Legacy Software} \label{sec:legacy} 

This group met only briefly, for one period on the first day. They discussed
that it is difficult to define legacy code because there is so much stigma
associated with the term. At some point there will be more difficulty and
resources wasted trying to keep legacy software supported, but it will
eventually be too expensive compared to how much it would be to just rebuild the
software or kill it. Most of the group members were not able to attend on the
second day, and those who were able to attend joined other groups.
