\subsection{Publishing Software Working Group Discussion} \label{sec:publishing-software}

\subsubsection{Why it is important}

This group explored the value of executable papers (papers whose content includes
the code needed to produce their own results), and other forms of publishing which
include dynamic electronic content. Transitioning to this type of publication offers
possibilities of addressing, or partially addressing sustainability concerns 
such as reproducibility, transitive credit, and best practices.

\subsubsection{Fit with related activities}

Reproducibility: Part of the purpose of these venues is to (at least partially)
address the reproducibility issue by making the paper itself recompute its own
results.

Transitive Credit: Since these forms of publishing must make their sources explicit,
they should be easier to trace even if appropriately worded credit for software
is not provided. In addition, these notebooks make it possible to provide/define
additional metadata to make the tracing of credit clearer. In addition, attributions
could be added to citations to identify whether a paper extends a result, verifies it,
contradicts it, etc.

Best Practices: Because an executable paper showcases the code, and the code itself
is subject to the review process, authors are more likely to pay attention to coding
practices. In addition, because the paper must explain what the code does, better
documentation is likely to be achieved.

\subsubsection{Discussion}

The group felt that the best way to encourage the use of these new publishing
concepts would be to create and curate a list identifying publishing venues
that support them. The Software Sustainability Institute agreed to host this list.

\subsubsection{Plans}

The plan is to create a web page describing executable papers, their value, and
a list of what publishers support them.

\subsubsection{Landing Page}

The afforementioned page to be published on SSI.
