Introduction to group here, including the overall objective of work in this area.

Something in here about this group having formed in reaction to one of the project suggestions made on the second day of the meeting.

On the second day of WSSSPE4, participants were challenged to share their ideas for ideal future world, list gaps that exist between now and future possibilities, and generate possible projects to bridge existing gaps to move us closer to the ideal vision of attendees. One of the possible projects listed was to "Define a standard for metadata to be used in current repos including authors, dependencies, ... repo url." Several attendees have been participating in a project, CodeMeta, that seeks to do just that. Interest in this possible was very high and an enthusiastic group formed with the object of fostering adoption of CodeMeta.

\subsubsection{More information \& joining instructions}

Because of the work done at WSSSPE4, the CodeMeta project README file\footnote{\url{https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/README.md}} was greatly expanded to include a description of the project that is geared to those with little or no prior knowledge of the project and including a list of contributors, information on how one can get involved, a bit of the project history and who is managing the project, and links to additional information.
