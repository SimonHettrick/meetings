% working groups on topics including developing pathways to funding scientific
% software; constructing useful common metrics for crediting software
% stakeholders; identifying principles for sustainable software engineering
% design; reaching out to research software organizations around the world; and
% building communities for software sustainability. For each group, we include a
% point of contact and a landing page that can be used by those who want to join
% that group's future activities. The main challenge left by the workshop is to
% see if the groups will execute these activities that they have scheduled, and

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Fourth Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE4)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/}} was
held on 12--14 September 2016 in Manchester, England, UK.
This location and date was selected so that WSSSPE4 immediately preceded the
First Conference of Research Software Engineers.
Previous events in the WSSSPE series include
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
held in conjunction with SC13;
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized jointly with the SciPy
conference\footnote{\url{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/wssspe/}};
WSSSPE2\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}}~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report,WSSSPE2},
held in conjunction with SC14;
WSSSPE2.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized again jointly with
SciPy\footnote{\url{http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/286469/}};
and WSSSPE3\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/}}~\cite{WSSSPE3},
held in Boulder, Colorado, USA.
Note that the WSSSPE series changed its name from ``Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences'' to ``Working towards
Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences'' to better reflect
the movement towards a community in addition to the associated workshop series.

\todo{Introduction}

The WSSSPE4 workshop included multiple mechanisms for participation and
encouraged team building around solutions. WSSSPE4 strongly encouraged participation
of early-career scientists, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students,
early-stage researchers, and those from underrepresented groups,
with funds provided to the conference organizers by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the Alfred P.~Sloan Foundation, and the Software
Sustainability Institute (SSI) to support the travel of potential participants
who would not otherwise be able to attend the workshop. These
funds allowed 29 additional people to attend and participate. A subset of the
organizing committee reviewed 44 applications for travel support and
competitively selected the awardees, including 11 students and five early-career
researchers. In addition, the travel award subcommittee tried to increase the
diversity of applicants by forwarding the notice of travel support to
organizations including PyLadies, Django Girls, Women Who Code, and
Women in HPC.\todo{add links}
\todo{did we reach out to any others?}

WSSSPE4 also included two professional event organizers/facilitators from
KnowInnovation who helped the organizing committee plan the workshop agenda,
and during the workshop, they actively engaged participants with various
tools, activities, and reminders.

\section{Calls for participation} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE4 was based on the work done in WSSSPE1, WSSSPE2, and WSSSPE3, but aimed
at \todo{what aimed at?}
as the calls for participation said:

two tracks:

\begin{quote}
    call for participation
\end{quote}

\todo{update}
The calls for participation requested papers describing lightning talks,
where each author could make a brief statement about work that either had been
done or was needed;
idea papers, which present implementable proposals related to Track 1;
position papers, which are longer, not previously published papers related to
Track 2 specifically discussing what we can do to improve sustainable scientific
software in the short term, starting with where we are today;
experience papers, longer papers related to Track 2 that discuss current
practices and experiences and how they have been used to improve the quality of
todayâ€™s research software and/or the experiences of its developers;
and demos, brief papers describing a 10--15 minute demonstration of a tool or
process relevant to Track 2 that improves the quality of today's research
software and\slash or the experiences of its developers.

There were~24 lightning talks submitted; after a peer-review process, 16
were accepted, as discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:lightning}.
