\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Fourth Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE4)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/}} was
held over 2 1/2 days on 12--14 September 2016 in Manchester, England, UK.
This location and date was selected so that WSSSPE4 immediately preceded the
First Research Software Engineers (RSE) Conference.
Previous events in the WSSSPE series include
WSSSPE1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1/}}~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report,WSSSPE1},
held in conjunction with SC13;
WSSSPE1.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe1-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized jointly with the SciPy
conference\footnote{\url{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/wssspe/}};
WSSSPE2\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/}}~\cite{WSSSPE2-pre-report,WSSSPE2},
held in conjunction with SC14;
WSSSPE2.1\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2-1/}}, a
focused workshop organized again jointly with
SciPy\footnote{\url{http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/286469/}};
and WSSSPE3\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe3/}}~\cite{WSSSPE3},
held in Boulder, Colorado, USA.
Note that the first WSSSPE workshop was named
``Working towards
Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences,'' which remains the meaning
of the WSSSPE group, but the workshops after that were named
``Workshop on Sustainable
Software for Science: Practice and Experiences.'' Together these reflect
that WSSSPE is both a community and a set of workshops.

\todo{Introduction}

The WSSSPE4 workshop included multiple mechanisms for participation and
encouraged team building around solutions. WSSSPE4 strongly encouraged participation
of early-career scientists, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students,
early-stage researchers, and those from underrepresented groups,
with funds provided to the conference organizers by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Alfred P.~Sloan Foundation, and the Software
Sustainability Institute (SSI) to support the travel of potential participants
who would not otherwise be able to attend the workshop. These
funds allowed 29 additional people to attend and participate. A subset of the
organizing committee reviewed 44 applications for travel support and
competitively selected the awardees, including 11 students and five early-career
researchers. In addition, the travel award subcommittee tried to increase the
diversity of applicants by forwarding the notice of travel support to
organizations including PyLadies, Django Girls, Women Who Code, and
Women in HPC.\todo{add links}
\todo{did we reach out to any others?}

WSSSPE4 also included two professional event organizers/facilitators from
KnowInnovation who helped the organizing committee plan the workshop agenda,
and during the workshop, they actively engaged participants with various
tools, activities, and reminders.

This workshop also introduced a Code of Conduct (CoC)
\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe4/code-of-conduct/}}
for both WSSSPE4 and interactions in the greater WSSSPE community (e.g., on
Twitter, in email lists, in the Slack team). The WSSSPE4 CoC is based on the
FORCE11 conference CoC~\cite{FORCE11:CoC}, in turn based on the Code4Lib
CoC~\cite{Code4Lib:CoC}.
The main guidelines of the CoC are:
\begin{quote}
    WSSSPE events are community events intended for networking and collaboration
    as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the
    community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
    experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
    courtesy to other attendees throughout the event and in interactions online
    associated with the event.

    The WSSSPE event organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free
    experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
    expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
    body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices,
    or other group status.

    To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in WSSSPE events and
    discussions---speakers, helpers, organizers, and participants---is required
    to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Communicate appropriately for a professional audience including
    people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not
    appropriate for any event.

    \item Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Be
    mindful of jargon, which can sometimes exclude others from engaging in the
    discussion.

    \item Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist,
    ageist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate.
    \end{itemize}
\end{quote}

The CoC was introduced at the beginning of WSSSPE4, with the CoC subcommittee
and a general email address introduced for reporting concerns or incidents, or
asking questions.  There was one concern mentioned to the CoC subcommittee
after the first half day,
regarding how part of the workshop was being run, and we changed the workshop
to address this.

This report is based on the events at the workshop and the submitted materials.
There events included discussion of the WSSSPE mission and vision, a keynote,
a set of presentations, a panel, and a number of working groups.  About a day of the
workshop was spent with participants in the working groups, which occurred in parallel
with each other.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Calls for participation} \label{sec:preworkshop}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WSSSPE4 was based on the work done in WSSSPE1, WSSSPE2, and WSSSPE3, but aimed
at producing working groups that better continued working after the workshop ended.
In addition, based on feedback after WSSSPE3, it became clear that WSSSPE attendees
had two different motivations in participating.  One motivation was to make a better future
for research software, and the other was to immediately do better research software development.
This led to the idea of WSSSPE4 being partially divided into two tracks:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Track 1 -- Building a sustainable future for open-use research
    software} has the goals of defining a vision of the future of open-use
    research software, and in the workshop, initiating the activities that are
    needed to get there. The idea of this track is to first think about where
    we want to be 5 to 10 years from now, without being too concerned with
    where we are today, and then to determine how we can move to this future.

    \textbf{Track 2 -- Practices \& experiences in sustainable scientific software}
    has the goal of improving the quality of today's research software and the
    experiences of its developers by sharing practices and experiences.
    This track is focused on the current state of scientific software and what
    we can do to improve it in the short term, starting with where we are today.
\end{quote}

The call for participation requested
idea papers, which present implementable proposals related to Track 1;
position papers, which are longer, not previously published papers related to
Track 2 specifically discussing what we can do to improve sustainable scientific
software in the short term, starting with where we are today;
experience papers, longer papers related to Track 2 that discuss current
practices and experiences and how they have been used to improve the quality of
today's research software and/or the experiences of its developers;
demos, brief papers describing a tool or
process that would be demonstrated, relevant to Track 2 that improves the quality of today's research
software and\slash or the experiences of its developers; and
extended abstracts describing lightning talks,
where each author could make a brief statement about work that either had been
done or was needed.

There were~24 lightning talks submitted; after a peer-review process, 16
were accepted, as discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:lightning}.
