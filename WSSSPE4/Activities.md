From Sou-Cheng Terrya Choi:

I think the existing features of the past WSSSPE workshops are fine. If some new components are to be considered for the WSSSPE4 program, then I would suggest the following:
  1.  short, hands-on course/demo of sustainable practices such as software citation, benchmarking software quality, etc.;
  2.  a poster session to engage undergraduate or graduate students;
  3.  follow-up reports from various WSSSPE3 working groups.


From Lorraine Hwang:

  How about adding case studies? I find working through examples very useful as the problems are not always as straightforward as they sound.

  WRT to ideas from WSSSPE3, I am reminded of a topic that keeps on coming up which was triggered by a recent article about who writes “better code”. The idea that recurs is that of offering some sort of software prize.  It could be fun to get a panel discussing and/or audience debate about what “good code”, “beautiful code” etc. means. There are certain tenets we probably can all agree on but after that it gets murky.

  The other idea to explore maybe similarly is the “Research Software Engineer”

From Michael R. Crusoe:

  I would suggest a session to kick off an open, collaborative grant writing process to increase scientific software maintenance capacity. Many projects aren't able to accept contributions (code, docs, or even money) making them F/OSS in name only thus missing out on the community aspect.

  For those concerned with writing a grant in a public, open fashion I offer this as inspiration: OpenDreamKit’s successful 7.6 EUR over 4 years grant https://github.com/sagemath/grant-europe

From Manish Parashar:

  Two aspects I would like to see in the workshop is the role of sustainable software in reproducibility, and approaches/best practices in credit/attribution for software. 

From Neil Chue Hong:

  I agree that there's still a purpose in holding WSSSPE meetings.

  I like Sou-Cheng's ideas (my personal preference would be for demos to be introduced with short 5 minute plenary slots, followed by a longer parallel session where people can ask questions/interact if they want to).

  I really like Michael's idea. I agree that a big issue with sustainability is the funding, and perhaps by working together more, we can become better at getting funding for the things we think collectively need it the most rather than a more scatter-gun approach.

  I also think that there should be a little more focus on the "doing" part of the meeting, where there's a selection of what the community thinks is most important ahead of time - the "what's going to kill us first" style of prioritisation - to enable participants to hit the ground running at the meeting. This might reduce the number of participants, as not everyone might be interested in the topic, but would ensure that we didn't spread ourselves too thin. Perhaps we could use the prioritisations from WSSSPE3 as a starting point?

  As for things we could do differently / in addition, two things come to mind (triggered by Lorraine's comments):
- More case studies, including negative or even neutral ones. We should be able to provide pointers to practices in use and how they turned out
- Create a list of evidence that will convince sceptics, and work together to tick off that list one by one

  For example:
- Employing a trained software engineer on a scientific software project leads to long-term savings and increased related scientific output over hiring more untrained postdocs / students
- If you have $10m this year to fund software in a specific area, when is it better to:
  1. Provide $10m to one project and ask all the others to merge with it or die
  2. Provide $2m to five projects to increase competition and innovation
  3. Provide short-fat funding to enable significant new functionality or refactoring
  4. Provide long-thin funding to enable retention of skills and ensure maintenance
  5. etc. etc.
- Addressing fears over open-sourcing scientific software (we created a list of fears [1]  as part of work on software development practice in the ELIXIR European Life Sciences consortium, along with initial attempts to address them, but it would be good to point to specific examples)

[1] This is a draft for information only, and shouldn't be seen as finished: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8sWr-r9RJBO-RZaDtgjmlHLHCyTHxsBrD6I12vknQs/edit#heading=h.bg6it3rwav23


From Abani Patra:

I think Sou-Cheng’s suggestions are great! I would add a discussion on nurturing "open software communities" and converting your "passive open" community to an "active open". I would add an interesting and informative  "keynote" -- I nominate Dan to do one!


From Colin Venters:

I think there is still value in a WSSSPE meeting. Despite the slide outlining our planned activities for the week, so far we have written 2/3 of a paper for CACM and the scientific case for a Horizon 2020 proposal or other suitable research funding call.

I think the emphasis of WSSSPE4 should be on more focused work with the emphasis on producing tangible output(s) by the end. The current workshop I am at runs for 5 days with a start time of 08:30 and a finish time of 22:00. Granted there is a 3 hour break in the afternoon for lunch and fun, and a 1 hour break for dinner.

I definitely need a holiday when I get back but feel a lot of satisfaction in all the hard work in producing tangible outputs.

From Ilian Todorov:

I like the best practices demo idea.  At least my project, DL_POLY, in my group is having a good stab at this (continuous integration and testing, cross OS building system, code coverage, etc.) and we can present.

Having other demos, non-HPC and non-Computational Chemistry, will be fun to have too.  Best practices exists but how they are improved and applied are interesting questions to be answered.  Whether these are followed and whether a research software engineer has the time, resources and infrastructure at their disposal to follow is a different matter.

From Timo Heister:

Yes, maybe we can go even further and sit down and:
1. generate materials/guides/example projects as a product of the workshop
2. produce a survey about how these aspects are currently treated in
various open source projects
3. going further, it might even be possible to set aside some time for
hacking on our own projects at the workshop to implement some of these
suggestions

I know that a suggestion like this might not be of interest for
everyone involved, but this would at least produce something tangible.

From Ketan Maheshwari:

Topics surrounding multi-platform software stack management might be of interest. This could include topics such as:
- Multi-platform testing for correctness and performance
- Software performance prediction over a set of architectures
- Software porting techniques to novell platforms
- Software evaluation criteria/techniques (eg. scale, correctness, verifiability)

From Kyle Niemeyer:
Based on [Dan’s blog post] (https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/how-should-we-add-citations-inside-software) about software citing papers or other software, I’d like to propose a hacking/implementation session on ways to solve this. We can have discussion on this topic ahead of the workshop and come up with a possible plan (or perhaps multiple options), then actually try and work on solutions in person.
